<h1 id="select-syscall">select() syscall</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>You might think that select() is for <strong>asynchronous I/O</strong>, but it is actually for <strong>synchronous I/O multiplexing</strong>. Don’t worry, I’ll explain <strong>select()</strong> and the concepts of <strong>multiplexing</strong> and <strong>synchronous I/O</strong> in detail. It may sound very complex at first but the I will simplify it.</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>
<p>Let’s consider a scenario where <strong>select()</strong> is helpful. Suppose you’ve written a server and client program using socket programming in C. When a client connects to the server, they may exchange messages for a few minutes. If another client tries to connect during this conversation, it would normally have to wait until the first client finishes.</p>
<p>Here’s where <strong>select()</strong> comes in. It allows the server to monitor multiple file descriptors (like client connections) and react to any activity. If a new client attempts to connect, or if an existing client sends a message, <strong>select()</strong> will notify the server, and the server can handle the request without waiting for the current client to finish.</p>
<p><strong>Multiplexing</strong> means handling multiple streams of data in a single <em>process or thread</em> without creating separate processes for each. <strong>Synchronous</strong> means that the program waits (or “blocks”) until an event happens, such as input data being available.</p>
<h2 id="syntax">Syntax</h2>
<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/select.h&gt;

int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds,
            fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout);</code></pre>
<p><code>nfds (int nfds):</code> This argument specifies the highest-numbered file descriptor that you want to monitor, plus 1. <code>readfds (fd_set *readfds):</code> This is a set of file descriptors that you want to check if they are ready for reading. <code>writefds (fd_set *writefds):</code> This is a set of file descriptors you want to check if they are ready for writing. <code>exceptfds (fd_set *exceptfds):</code> This is a set of file descriptors you want to check for exceptional conditions. <code>timeout (struct timeval *timeout):</code> This is a timeout value that specifies how long select() should wait before returning. It is a time limit for how long select() should block and wait for an event to occur.</p>
